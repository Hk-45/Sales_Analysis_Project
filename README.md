# Sales_Analysis_Project
create a power bi dashboard with the sales data and run some SQL queries
We create a Sales data after creating data I clean the data means remove duplicate and change datatype of certain columns.
After this I create a dashboard in power bi and show a bar chart of sales per product, Line chart showing sales over the time and pie chart shows sales distribution and table chart shows top salesperson and there sales.
It help the Client to understand easily what is happing in the sales database.
Also create a slicer by years to easily filter the data by years.
